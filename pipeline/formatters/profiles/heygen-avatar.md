## Script Guidelines

Create a natural-sounding script for AI avatar video (2-5 minutes):

1. **Opening** (10-15 seconds):
   - Warm greeting
   - Brief intro of topic
   - Hook to keep watching

2. **Script Format**:
   - Write in conversational spoken language
   - Use contractions (I'm, you'll, we're)
   - Include natural pauses: [PAUSE]
   - Mark emphasis: *important word*
   - Add gesture cues: [GESTURE: nod]

3. **Pacing**:
   - ~150 words per minute
   - Short sentences (8-15 words)
   - Vary sentence length for rhythm
   - Include transition phrases

4. **Visual Cues** (for editor):
   - [B-ROLL: description]
   - [GRAPHIC: text to display]
   - [TRANSITION]

5. **Engagement**:
   - Direct address ("you")
   - Rhetorical questions
   - "Here's the thing..." transitions
   - Summarize key points

6. **Closing** (10-15 seconds):
   - Recap main takeaway
   - Clear call-to-action
   - Friendly sign-off

Write as if speaking directly to one person, maintaining eye contact.
