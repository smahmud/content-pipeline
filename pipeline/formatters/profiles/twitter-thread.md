   - Tweet 9-10: Practical takeaways
   - Final Tweet: CTA + invite engagement

3. **Tweet Format**:
   - Max 280 characters per tweet
   - Use line breaks for readability
   - Include relevant emojis sparingly
   - End threads with "🧵" indicator

4. **Engagement Tactics**:
   - Ask questions to prompt replies
   - Use "Here's what I learned:" or "The truth is:"
   - Include a "bookmark this" reminder

Keep each tweet punchy and self-contained while building narrative momentum.
