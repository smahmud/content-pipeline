   - Include a "pattern interrupt" mid-post
   - Build to a key insight or lesson

3. **Content Elements**:

   - Include data or concrete examples
   - Offer actionable takeaways
   - Show vulnerability or lessons learned

4. **Engagement Drivers**:

   - Tag relevant people (placeholder: [TAG])

5. **Formatting**:
   - Use → or • for lists
   - Emojis sparingly (0-3 max)
   - No hashtags in body (add 3-5 at end)

Maintain professional credibility while being authentically engaging.
