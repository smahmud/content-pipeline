# Release v0.8.5 - Technical Debt Fix

**Release Date:** February 19, 2026

## Overview

This is a maintenance release that fixes technical debt from the v0.7.5 provider architecture migration. All enrichment tests have been updated to use the correct provider terminology.

## What's Fixed

### Test Terminology Updates
All enrichment test files have been updated from old agent terminology to new provider terminology:
- `agent_factory` → `provider_factory`
- `create_agent` → `create_provider`
- `mock_agent` → `mock_provider`
- `AgentFactory` → `LLMProviderFactory`

### Production Code Bug
Fixed `pipeline/enrichment/batch.py` which still used `agent_factory` in the `_estimate_batch_cost` method.

### Mock Patch Paths
Updated test mock decorators to patch correct module paths:
- `@patch('openai.OpenAI')` instead of `@patch('pipeline.llm.providers.cloud_openai.OpenAI')`
- `@patch('anthropic.Anthropic')` instead of old agent paths

### Test Infrastructure
- Fixed `EnrichmentOrchestrator` constructor calls to use `provider_factory=` keyword
- Updated timing assertions in batch tests to use `>= 0` for mocks that return instantly

## Files Updated

### Test Files
- `tests/integration/test_enrichment_providers.py`
- `tests/integration/test_enrichment_cli.py`
- `tests/integration/test_enrichment_chunking.py`
- `tests/integration/test_enrichment_batch.py`
- `tests/integration/test_infrastructure_workflows.py`
- `tests/pipeline/enrichment/test_batch.py`
- `tests/property_tests/test_enrichment_properties.py`

### Production Code
- `pipeline/enrichment/batch.py` (bug fix)

## Test Results

All 88 enrichment tests now pass (3 skipped for complex provider scenarios that require additional setup).

## Notes

- No behavioral changes - purely mechanical refactoring
- Debug scripts in `tests/my-test-scripts/` not updated (not part of test suite)
- This release clears the high-priority technical debt items from the backlog
